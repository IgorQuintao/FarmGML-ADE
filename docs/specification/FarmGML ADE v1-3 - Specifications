 Detailed Description of the FarmGML ADE v1.3 Schema Modules
The FarmGML Application Domain Extension (ADE) is a modular extension of 
CityGML 3.0 designed to represent agricultural and rural information in a semantically 
rich, spatially explicit way.
Each module corresponds to a thematic domain — such as farm structure, production, 
operations, risk, or sustainability — and can operate independently or as part of an 
integrated semantic model.
---
 farm-core.xsd — Core conceptual and structural model
The farm-core.xsd schema defines the conceptual foundation of the FarmGML ADE.
It introduces the key entities, properties, and relationships that form the backbone of all 
other modules.
Main Components
farm:RuralProperty — Represents the fundamental legal and spatial unit of the model.
Includes cadastral, administrative, and locational attributes such as CAR code, IBGE 
municipality, ownership, and boundary geometry.
farm:LandUnit — Subdivision of the rural property, used to represent functional areas 
such as fields, forests, and facilities.
farm:FarmProfile — Describes the enterprise profile, including legal status, market 
integration, and record-keeping behavior.
farm:FarmSize, farm:PhysicalSizeAAU, farm:EconomicSize — Represent both physical 
and economic dimensions of the holding.
Purpose
Acts as the semantic core of the ADE, providing base types and properties that extend 
core:AbstractFeatureType from CityGML.
All other modules reference or specialize these foundational classes.
---
 farm-enterprise.xsd — Organizational and legal enterprise structures
The farm-enterprise.xsd module models agricultural enterprises, covering their 
organizational, legal, and economic identity.
It bridges physical property data with business and administrative information.
Main Components
farm:AbstractRuralEnterprise — Abstract superclass for all enterprise types.
farm:AgroIndustrialUnit, farm:Cooperative, farm:FamilyFarm — Specializations for 
different production and governance models.
farm:holderID, farm:officialID — Legal identifiers such as tax numbers, registry entries, 
or producer IDs.
farm:enterpriseLocation — Spatial link to the geographic representation of the enterprise.
Purpose
Provides a semantic link between spatial assets and economic actors, enabling integration 
with cadastral, regulatory, and financial systems.
---
 farm-production.xsd — Productive land use and crop systems
The farm-production.xsd module defines the productive domain of the FarmGML model, 
focusing on crop areas, pastures, and forestry systems.
It captures both the spatial extent and the agronomic attributes of each productive unit.
Main Components
farm:AnnualCropArea, farm:PerennialCropArea, farm:PastureArea — Specialized landuse features derived from veg:PlantCoverType.
farm:CropCycle — Temporal representation of planting, growth, and harvesting periods.
farm:HarvestedLot — Records production output with traceability and commercialization 
attributes.
farm:TraceabilityInfo — Includes blockchain hash, certification codes, or internal 
tracking IDs.
farm:lod0Geometry, farm:lod1Geometry — 2D/3D spatial geometries in UTM or local 
coordinate systems.
Purpose
Serves as the operational heart of the ADE, representing what is produced, where, and 
under what conditions — supporting analytics on yields, management efficiency, and 
land use.
---
 farm-operations.xsd — Agricultural operations and temporal dynamics
The farm-operations.xsd module captures on-farm activities and temporal dynamics, such 
as irrigation, tillage, fertilization, and harvesting events.
Main Components
farm:Operation — Abstract superclass for all operational activities.
farm:FieldTask, farm:MachineryUse, farm:IrrigationEvent — Specific types of 
operations with temporal and resource parameters.
farm:DynamicParameter — Extends core:AbstractDynamizerType to link time-varying 
sensor or observation data.
farm:operationCost, farm:resourceUse — Optional attributes for economic and input-use 
indicators.
Purpose
Enables representation of processes and events over time, supporting simulation, 
efficiency assessment, and precision-agriculture analytics.
---
 farm-risk.xsd — Agricultural risk and insurance modeling
The farm-risk.xsd module handles climatic and insurance-related risk assessment, aligned 
with Brazil’s ZARC (Agroclimatic Risk Zoning) framework.
Main Components
farm:InsuranceRisk — Central class for risk evaluation at the crop or enterprise level.
farm:ZarcScore, farm:RiskClassificationKey — Reference indices and classification 
codes.
farm:calculationDate, farm:riskLevel — Attributes describing validity period and 
severity of risk.
Purpose
Supports the integration of risk data into spatial decision-making, linking agricultural 
insurance, climate vulnerability, and farm management systems.
---
 farm-sustainability.xsd — Environmental indicators and sustainability metrics
The farm-sustainability.xsd module provides a framework for environmental 
performance indicators and sustainable management metrics.
Main Components
farm:SustainabilityIndicator — Generic structure for sustainability assessment.
farm:carbonFootprint, farm:waterUsageEfficiency, farm:biodiversityIndex, 
farm:bioinputUsageRate — Core indicators of sustainability.
farm:certificationType, farm:complianceStandard — Optional attributes for certification 
schemes and regulatory frameworks.
Purpose
Facilitates quantitative evaluation of environmental performance, supporting 
certification, carbon accounting, and eco-efficiency benchmarking.
---
 farm-temporal.xsd — Temporal modeling and versioning
The farm-temporal.xsd module extends CityGML’s temporal model 
(core:AbstractTimeSliceType) to support agricultural state management and change 
tracking.
Main Components
farm:TemporalState — Generic temporal representation of any FarmGML feature.
farm:CropTimeSlice, farm:OperationTimeSlice — Time slices for specific domains 
(production or operation).
farm:validFrom / farm:validTo — Validity periods of a temporal state.
farm:timeSeriesLink — Reference to time-series datasets or dynamic sensor 
observations.
Purpose
Allows full temporal versioning and “Digital Twin” synchronization, enabling 
longitudinal analysis and historical reconstruction of agricultural systems.
---
 farm-hooks.xsd — ADE integration and interoperability framework
The farm-hooks.xsd module establishes the integration layer between FarmGML and the 
CityGML 3.0 core, defining how ADE components attach to existing CityGML feature 
types.
Main Components
farm:_GenericApplicationPropertyOfRuralProperty — Entry point for user-defined or 
domain-specific extensions.
core:_ADEComponent — Integration mechanism to embed ADE properties within 
CityGML features.
farm:ADEOfBuilding, farm:ADEOfLandUse — Optional extension hooks for the 
Building and LandUse modules.
Purpose
Ensures semantic and structural interoperability with the broader CityGML ecosystem —
allowing rural, agricultural, and environmental data to coexist seamlessly with urban and 
infrastructure models.
